### <a href="https://glittering-cactus-b3259f.netlify.app">WorldCup Website</a>

A World Cup website is a website that provides information and updates about the FIFA World Cup, which is a global soccer tournament held every four years.

In my implementation, I used HTML and CSS to design and structure the website. HTML was used to create the basic layout of the webpage, while CSS was used to style the webpage with colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
